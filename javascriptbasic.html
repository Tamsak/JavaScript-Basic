           <h2>JavaScript Basic</h2>
            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform,object-oriented scripting language.
               Javascript is extreamely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and
               lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it
               in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment
               (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these 
               environments to provide programmatic control over them.
            </p>

                <li>
                <a href="Variables-Declaration">Variables Declaration</a>
                  JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values-imangine a cup you fill
                  with a coffee, the cup holds the coffee,a variables holds a value. All JavaScript variables
                  must be indentified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers.<span class="v">var x;</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <a href="Variables-Assignments">Variables Assignments</a>
                  Assignment operators assign values to JavaScripts variables=our cup can now have coffee poured in it
                  giving our variable a value to hold. The=assignment operator assign a value to a variable.<span class="v">var x=10;</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <a href="Data-Type">Data Type</a>Data Types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type.
                  There are six data type that are JavaScript primitives:Booleen-<span class="v">true or false;</span>
                  null-<span class="v">null;</span>aka nothing;Number-<span class="v">42 or 3.14159;</span>
                  String-<span class="v">"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span>Array-<span class="v">[1,'Coding',2,'Dojo'];</span>
                  and Objects-<span class="v">{first_name:'Jane',last_name:'Doe'}</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <a href="Conditionals">Conditionals</a>
                  When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different desicions-hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions
                  that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. These are the following conditonal statements:
                  <span class="v">if;</span> a specified conditiona is true, do this code block;<span class="v">else if;</span>
                  to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition s false; <span class="v">else;</span>we excecute this block code;
                </li>
                <li>
                  <a href="Loops">Loops</a>
                  There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action
                  some number of items. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times ans then you stop.That's a loop!
                </li>
                <li>
                  <a href="Function">Function</a>
                  Functions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instruction.
                  As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we
                  screw the legs to the tanle top; next we place the way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly ther are a ton more tables to do so 
                  lets call our function over and over and over again.
